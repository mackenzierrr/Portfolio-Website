# Final as of 9/18
Mackenzie's Portfolio Website

Description: This is an assignment for my software development class, but will be maintained an added onto as a dev blog via the currently unfinished scrapbook section.

Design Choices: I wanted this website not to be entirely soulless and professional, but reflect a bit of me as well. That's why I picked my colors and images the way I did.

MVP Decisions: I wasn't limited to an MVP since I wasnt starting from scratch, so I went about making the website fully functional.

Contact Information: Methods of contact are listed under the contact page of my portfolio :)

Challenges & Lessons Learned: I struggled a lot with integrating email functionality as well as animations. Through the help of my classmates, teacher, and youtube, I managed to get everything working. I learned a lot about CSS, more than I expected to!

Future Improvements: I'm going to continue to update this and log my progress in the scrapbook section :)

Credits / References : Big thank you to my peers and my teacher for helping out with any bumps I hit.
Stack overflow user vals made a really good template for fading between images that I changed to my needs.
I used EmailJS for the HTML form functionality, as well as this tutorial on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRFh7Ep35lc
